    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        These blueberry muffins are extra large and yummy with a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. 
        I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin.
        Add extra blueberries if you want!
    </p>
    <p>
        This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. 
        A buttery streusel topping takes this indulgent breakfast over the top.
